Roboswag is a tool that automatically generates Python libraries out of your Swagger (OpenAPI specification
file). These libraries can be used to create tests with various payload content and its validation. It also supports
response validation against schema and verification of different status codes.

.. note::

    The tool is in the **Alpha** state, which means it may be unstable and should be used at your own risk. Some
    features may be broken and there are still many things to be developed. Happy testing!

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs.
