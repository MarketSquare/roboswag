Roboswag 0.4.0
===================
Major improvements for our internal test framework and utilities.
We also added support for openAPI v3 (in json and yaml format).

You can install the latest available version by running::

    pip install --upgrade roboswag

or to install exactly this version::

    pip install roboswag==0.4.0

OpenAPI v3 support
-------------------
Roboswag is now tested with openAPI v3 and supports it (`#24 <https://github.com/MarketSquare/roboswag/issues/24>`_).
It also works with both ``json`` and ``yaml`` formats (`#25 <https://github.com/MarketSquare/roboswag/issues/25>`_).

Other
-----
- It is now possible to generate test libraries under selected path using ``--output-dir`` option (`#55 <https://github.com/MarketSquare/roboswag/issues/55>`_)
- Generated test libraries are now more compact thanks to minor adjustments of whitespace (`#53 <https://github.com/MarketSquare/roboswag/issues/53>`_)
- Major refactor of the test library generation code (`#54 <https://github.com/MarketSquare/roboswag/issues/54>`_)

Fixes
------
- Handle optional properties from openAPI v3 (`#51 <https://github.com/MarketSquare/roboswag/issues/51>`_)
- Renamed "validate.error" to "validate.response_as_text" since it can be used for successful responses as well (`#51 <https://github.com/MarketSquare/roboswag/issues/51>`_)
- Description field of the responses is now not used for validation - we are creating comment with TODO message instead (`#56 <https://github.com/MarketSquare/roboswag/issues/56>`_)

E2E
----
Created E2E test framework (`#51 <https://github.com/MarketSquare/roboswag/issues/51>`_, `#57 <https://github.com/MarketSquare/roboswag/issues/57>`_).
It allows us to define our own, small APIs and then:

- we generate openAPI specification file,
- roboswag use this file to generate test libraries,
- test framework starts API server,
- test runs robot tests using generated test libraries against API

Thanks for that we can replicate full user workflow and isolate different types of API configuration.
