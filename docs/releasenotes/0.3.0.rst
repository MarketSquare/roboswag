Roboswag 0.3.0
=========================================
Fixes and changes to improve Roboswag compatibility with OpenAPi v2. Also our project went through
transformation - we added automated workflows, started working on tests and
initialized external documentation.

You can install the latest available version by running::

    pip install --upgrade roboswag

or to install exactly this version::

    pip install roboswag==0.3.0

CLI refactor
-------------
Roboswag CLI went through major refactor. Now we are using click instead of argparse.
It includes backward incompatible change - if you want to generate Python files you need to use
``generate`` command (`#32 <https://github.com/MarketSquare/roboswag/issues/32>`_).

Old::

    roboswag -s spec.json

New::

    roboswag generate -s spec.json

Fixes
------
- If the definition didn't have properties, it defaulted to empty list while Roboswag expected dict (`#43 <https://github.com/MarketSquare/roboswag/issues/43>`_)
- Refatored pythonify name method to be more efficient (`#43 <https://github.com/MarketSquare/roboswag/issues/43>`_)
- If the model didn't have any properties, it failed to generate (`#43 <https://github.com/MarketSquare/roboswag/issues/43>`_)
- Properties can contain names which are reserved words in Python (like global) and it failed to generate (`#43 <https://github.com/MarketSquare/roboswag/issues/43>`_)
- Roboswag didn't work on Python 3.7 (`#39 <https://github.com/MarketSquare/roboswag/issues/39>`_)
